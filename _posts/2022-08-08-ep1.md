I can't think of anyone better to inaugurate this series than my good friend and big brother Philip Hayton, a world class software developer specialising in remote work and distributed teams.

From founding early stage startups to contracting for European unicorns, Phil has done it all and seen it all, and along the way has never stopped putting the right values first and telling it like it is.

On a personal note, I wouldn't be where I am today without Phil's mentorship when we worked side by side in Newcastle.
