This episode I'm joined by Matthew Woods, co-founder and CEO of AFK Creators, an international talent and influencer agency specialising in the esports and gaming industry.

From the best player on Xbox Live in school, to a whirlwind of marketing startups, even being signed as a pro gamer to an international e-sports team along the way before striking out for himself, it's clear that Matt has brought his passion and skill together and created a unique career for himself.
